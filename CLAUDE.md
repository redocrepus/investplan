# Agent Instructions

## Documentation Maintenance

Every code change must include updates to all relevant documentation:

- **README.md** — Keep install, dev-run, test, and build instructions accurate
- **Requirements.md** — Keep feature/input/output specifications in sync with implementation
- **requirements.txt** — Keep dependency list accurate with pinned versions
- **plan.md** — Update checklists and architecture when implementation changes
- **GUI tooltips** — Keep all input field tooltips accurate and consistent with documentation

No change is complete until documentation is updated.
